# 01-Guessing
 first project for C220, a guessing game, written in Python. The purpose of this is to teach me about simple data types and control structures.
 The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. They have as many opportunities as they need to get it correct. The game returns the total number of tries taken to guess it.
